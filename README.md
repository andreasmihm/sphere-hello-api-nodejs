# Node.js Hello API

This repo contains some example to show how easy is to use the SPHERE.IO API.

**Make sure to have some Products and Categories in your project if you want to see something**

Examples:
- `simple` fetch some products using a command-line like script
- `express` starter kit using an Express.js application

Create the `config` first and provide your project credentials

```bash
$ ./create_config.sh
```
